In the context of phenomena pertaining to the nervous system, our objective was to pinpoint terms associated with its functions and dysfunctions across various scales, from cellular operations to broader mental processes and their impairments. Additionally, we aimed to catalog its pathologies, along with the respective signs, symptoms, and findings.

We used the following semantic types (TUI):
- Acquired Abnormality (T020)
- Anatomical Abnormality (T190)
- Behavior (T053)
- Biologic Function (T038)
- Congenital Abnormality (T019)
- Disease or Syndrome (T047)
- Individual Behavior (T055)
- Mental Process (T041)
- Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction (T048)
- Natural Phenomenon or Process (T070)
- Neoplastic Process (T191)
- Organ or Tissue Function (T042)
- Organism Function (T040)
- Pathologic Function (T046)
- Physiologic Function (T039)
- Sign or Symptom (T184)
- Social Behavior (T054)
