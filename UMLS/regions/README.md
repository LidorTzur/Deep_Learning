Among the anatomical structures, we sought to find concepts related to the hu-
man nervous system, excluding purely vascular or musculoskeletal structures, and
indirectly related entities such as the outer ear and eye lens.

We used the following semantic types (TUI):
- Anatomical Structure (T017)
- Body Location or Region (T029)
- Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component (T023)
- Body Space or Junction (T030)
- Body Substance (T031)
- Body System (T022)
- Cell (T025)
- Cell Component (T026)
- Fully Formed Anatomical Structure (T021)
- Hormone (T125)
- Receptor (T192)
- Tissue (T024)

1000 hand-annotated test concepts:
`test_concepts.json` and `test_labels.json`.

1000 hand-annotated training concepts:
`train_gold_concepts.json` and `train_gold_labels.json`.
