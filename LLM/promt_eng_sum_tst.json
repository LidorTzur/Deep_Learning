    "Overall, the 1995 movie version of Bye Bye Birdie is a disappointing remake that fails to live up to the original 1963 film. Despite good casting choices, the film is too long and adds unnecessary new songs and scenes, which detract from the overall experience. The addition of new songs, such as \"Let's Settle Down,\" may have been an attempt to breathe new life into the story but ends up feeling unnecessary and overly lengthy. The film's pacing is slow, and some actors, such as Chyna Phillips and Jason Alexander, overdo their roles, making it difficult to fully invest in the story. However, Vanessa Williams shines in her role and provides some much-needed sparkle to the production. Ultimately, the 1995 movie version of Bye Bye Birdie is a disappointing remake that fails to capture the magic of the original. If you're a fan of the play, it's best to stick with the 1963 film, which remains a timeless classic.",
    "The overall sentiment of this movie review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer thoroughly enjoyed the episode, particularly the inclusion of the Justice League members like The Flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow, and Aquaman. They were thrilled to see these characters brought to life and the excitement was palpable. The reviewer found themselves wishing for a longer episode, as one hour felt too short for the thrilling adventure they were witnessing.

    "Overall, the sentiment of the review is negative. The reviewer disagrees with the portrayal of the Ohio Valley in the film, finding it to be inaccurate and condescending.

    "The overall sentiment of the review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer criticizes the film for its \"over-heated plot\" and lack of depth, with the central character of Jean Seberg being particularly faulted for her inability to carry the film. Despite the presence of well-known actors like David Niven and Deborah Kerr, the reviewer believes that the film is mediocre and lacks impact. The reviewer suggests that Seberg, who was only 20 at the time of the film's release, was not yet a skilled actress and needed more experience before being given leading roles.

    "Overall, the reviewer has a disappointing sentiment towards the movie \"SherryBaby\". They criticize the storyline as being too simplistic and expected, and argue that the emotional emphasis is misplaced. The reviewer finds that the movie's focus on the protagonist's drug addiction and struggle to win back her daughter's love is not compelling enough, and they express confusion about whether they are supposed to feel sorry for the character or the innocent child caught in the middle. Despite Maggie Gyllenhaal's strong performance, the reviewer concludes that the movie is not worth watching.",

    "The movie under review is a disappointing and cringeworthy \"B\" film that lacks a coherent plot. Instead, it serves as a vehicle to showcase popular music groups of 1942, with each group given only a few minutes of screen time. The only notable moment in the film is a brief appearance by Duke Ellington's band, which features a segregated train car and a disappointing \"uncle Tom\" performance by trumpeter/violinist Ray Nance. Overall, the film is a waste of time and is best avoided.",
    "Overall Sentiment: Positive\nThe movie review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing delight in watching the film multiple times and praising the performance of the cast. The reviewer notes that the Iron Masked Marauder was \"pretty mean\" in his capture of Celebi, but is relieved when Ash and Sam manage to snap him out of his control. The inclusion of only one song in the ending credits is seen as a minor drawback, but the reviewer continues to express their overall enthusiasm for the film. The reviewer concludes that Pokemon 4Ever was a success and that people will always love the film.",
    "Overall, the movie \"Maria Braun\" is a thought-provoking and captivating portrayal of a strong-willed woman navigating through a post-war German society. The film, directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, explores themes of feminism, loneliness, and excess as Maria Braun, played by Hanna Schygulla, seeks to find success and happiness in a world that seems to be against her.\nThe movie follows Maria's journey as she marries a man who is sent to a Russian prison camp, and after his disappearance, she begins to work at a bar for American GI's and eventually rises to a high-ranking position in a German business. Throughout the film, Maria's character is portrayed as confident, sexy, and unapologetic, but also lonely and lost.\nOne of the most striking aspects of the film is the way Fassbinder employs a heavy-handed metaphor for a country trying to move on from a devastating war. The bombed-out buildings and the radio broadcasts of a divided Germany serve as a backdrop for Maria's journey, highlighting the disarray and uncertainty of the time.\nHanna Schygulla gives an incredible performance as Maria, capturing the glamour and allure of an old-time Hollywood female star while also showcasing the vulnerability and strength of a woman who has seen it all. The costume design and the use of lighting also add to the overall aesthetic of the film, creating a sense of luxury and excess that is juxtaposed with the desolation of the setting.\nWhile the movie is not without its flaws, \"Maria Braun\" is a thought-provoking and visually stunning portrayal of a complex and intriguing character. It's a must-see for fans of Fassbinder and of Hanna Schygulla's work, as well as anyone interested in exploring the themes of feminism and masculinity in a post-war German context.",
    "Overall, the movie review is extremely positive, with the reviewer praising the cast, story, and emotional impact of the film.

They also highlight the on-screen chemistry between the leads, Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths, and praise the music in the film, calling it \"magnificent.\" The reviewer notes that the movie is \"real\" and \"worth every minute\" (emphasis added), ultimately giving it an 8/10 rating.\nThe only criticisms mentioned are that the reviewer would have given the baseball to someone else and that the supporting characters, such as the nuns, could have been better integrated into the story. However, these criticisms are minor compared to the overall positive assessment of the film.\nIn summary, the review is very positive, highlighting the film's emotional impact, realistic portrayal, and strong cast performances. The reviewer notes that the movie is \"a true story about the Devil Ray's mid-life rookie, Jimmy Morris\" and praises the film's ability to capture the \"dreams - dripping in reality\" of the American Dream.",

    "This movie reviewer was thoroughly unimpressed with the recent werewolf film they watched. They had high expectations due to their love for the genre, but were let down by the poor storyline, bad acting, and subpar effects. The reviewer found the story to be a shallow and uncreative take on the werewolf mythos, with plot points that felt like they were trying too hard to be clever. The effects were particularly poor, with the werewolf transformation scene being laughably bad. The only positive aspects of the film were the cinematography and some of the performances, but even those were not enough to save the movie from its overall disappointing quality. Overall, the reviewer recommends avoiding this film and instead opting for other classics in the werewolf genre.",
    "Overall, the movie review is negative and expresses frustration with the lackluster ending of the film. The reviewer feels that the movie had potential but failed to deliver a satisfying conclusion, instead feelin like it was rushed and incomplete. The reviewer recommends saving money and watching only the first 75% of the movie, then using one's imagination to finish the story. They use strong language, such as \"really feels like they got all but the last 15 minutes done,\" and \"Wish I had more thumbs, so I could give that movie 4 thumbs down!\" to emphasize their disappointment. The sentiment of the review is one of disappointment and frustration with the movie's conclusion.",
    "The movie reviewer has a very negative sentiment towards the film they are reviewing. They describe it as a collection of cliches, with no focus, goals, or real message. The symbolism is pushed too far and the stereotyping is abundant and outrageous. The acting is over the top, with exaggerated emotion and forced directing. The reviewer also mentions that the film has inaccuracies in portraying punk rock and the characters wander without a clear role, detail, or motive. The locations are arbitrary and the reviewer compares the film unfavorably to other successful movies like Boogie Nights, Good Fellas, and Saturday Night Fever. The only positive comment made is about the good cinematography. Overall, the reviewer has a very negative sentiment towards the film and expresses no desire to see anything else from the director.",
    "Overall, \"1408\" is a movie that relies too heavily on shock value rather than developing a compelling plot or providing adequate backstory. Despite some intriguing elements, such as the mysterious Room 1408 and its seemingly evil presence, the film fails to deliver on its promises by not exploring these concepts further. The movie's reliance on cliched horror tropes, such as reflections in mirrors, things just out of sight, and changing paintings, becomes tiresome and predictable.\nMoreover, the movie's characters are underdeveloped, with the main character's motivation for writing a book about Room 1408 being left unexplained. The film also suffers from inconsistencies, such as the fact that electronics don't work in Room 1408 except for the TV, despite the fact that the main character's cell phone has no signal.\nUltimately, \"1408\" is a disappointing horror movie that relies too heavily on shock value rather than developing a thoughtful and engaging story.",

The review concludes that the film is not worth seeking out, and that viewers may find themselves waiting for it to end due to its tedium.",
    "The overall sentiment of this movie review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer is frustrated with the film's lack of depth in terms of characters, plot, and surprise, and feels that it wastes a great cast and director's potential. Despite the actors' best efforts, the one-dimensional writing makes the film unworthy of recommendation. The reviewer does acknowledge some positive aspects, such as the film's noir-like feel and the performances of Glenn Ford and Herbert Walton, but these are not enough to make up for the film's overall lack of substance. The summary should convey this overall negativity while maintaining the same tone and language as the original review.",
    "Overall, the reviewer has a strong affection for the 1930s Warner Bros. musicals, particularly \"Footlight Parade,\" starring James Cagney. While all three films are classics in their own right, the reviewer found \"Footlight Parade\" to be the standout due to Cagney's infectious energy and the film's pace, energy, and script. The reviewer praises the supporting cast, particularly Joan Blondell, and Busby Berkeley's surreal, suggestive, and risqu\u00e9 dance numbers. However, the reviewer notes that the era of gentility and morality in the film industry led to the decline of such richly made musicals. The overall sentiment of the review is one of nostalgia and admiration for a bygone era of musical cinema.",
    "Overall, the reviewer found the TV episode \"Crouch End\" to be of poor quality, with stilted and cringe-worthy dialogue, poor acting, and unwatchable special effects. The characters were seen as cartoonish and stereotypical, with little depth or development.

In conclusion, the reviewer compares the quality of \"Crouch End\" to that of the NBC series \"Hercules\", which they do not have a high opinion of. Overall sentiment of the review is negative.",
    "Overall, the reviewer has a very negative opinion of the show, with sentiment leaning towards disapproval and disappointment.

They express surprise that the show made it to a second season, considering the poor quality they observed in the first two episodes. The reviewer is a self-proclaimed Sci-Fi fan and \"geek,\" but they believe that this show does not meet their expectations in terms of writing, acting, and production quality. In summary, the reviewer had a very negative experience with the show and found it to be poorly made, even for a Sci-Fi series.",
    "Overall, the movie review is very positive and suggests that the film is a masterpiece. The reviewer praises the intensity of the images, the way the film moves along, and the excellent acting and script. The reviewer also highlights the allegorical nature of the film, suggesting that it is a powerful examination of the effects of violence on the psyche.

The overall sentiment of the review is one of praise and admiration for the film's emotional depth and artistic merit.",
    "The sentiment of the review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer highlights Good Times as a groundbreaking comedy that portrays a nuclear black family in the Chicago projects in a realistic and relatable way.

The reviewer specifically praises the character of JJ and his antics, as well as the way the show tackles difficult issues like drugs, gangs, and alcoholism without being preachy. The only criticism mentioned is the death of the father, but even this is not enough to detract from the overall positive sentiment of the review. Overall, the reviewer is enthusiastic about the show and its portrayal of a loving and supportive family despite the challenges they face.",
    "The overall sentiment of the review is disappointment. The reviewer enjoyed Margaret Atwood's novel \"The Robber Bride\" but was unhappy with the movie adaptation. They feel that the movie focuses too much on the story of two male characters, while ignoring the interesting female characters from the book. The reviewer believes that the movie's decision to prioritize the male characters' story over the female characters' is a betrayal of the feminist themes in the original novel. They also mention that they would have enjoyed the movie more if they hadn't read the book, as it would have been more of a surprise. Overall, the reviewer is negative towards the movie's approach and feels that it misses the opportunity to explore the complex female characters from the novel.",
    "The movie review expresses disappointment in the film \"The Fan\" which is compared unfavorably to the classic \"Taxi Driver\".

The overall sentiment of the review is negative, as the reviewer found the film to be inferior to \"Taxi Driver\" and failed to engage the viewer.",
    "Overall, the reviewer found the film adaptation of \"War and Peace\" to be disappointing, particularly in its pacing and cinematography. Despite having read the book 25 years ago and enjoying it, the reviewer found the film to be slow-moving and dragging in parts, making it difficult to stay engaged. The reviewer also found the camera work to be distracting and self-indulgent, rather than serving to advance the story. Despite these issues, the revieweracknowledges that they may be missing something and that the film may be intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation, which could potentially improve the viewing experience. However, based on the parts of the film that they were able to sit through, the reviewer was not impressed.\n Sentiment: Disappointing, slow-moving, self-indulgent, confusing.",

They also praise Jennifer Beals' performance as Cinderella, particularly in the garden scene with Matthew Broderick's Prince Charming. However, the reviewer notes that Jean Stapleton's portrayal of the fairy godmother was somewhat marred by what they perceive as an inconsistent characterization, particularly with some of the lines.

Overall, the review expresses a positive sentiment towards the \"Faerie Tale Theatre\" series and this particular adaptation of Cinderella.",
    "The overall sentiment of this movie review is negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment that Irene Dunne, a highly respected actress, chose to end her career with a film that is \"okay\" but \"unmemorable\" and \"almost unknown.\" The reviewer finds the first half of the movie to be better than the second half, which becomes \"pretty stupid.\" They also find Dunne's high-pitched voice to be annoying at times. The reviewer notes that the story is reminiscent of a 1950s television sitcom and that David Nelson, from the Ozzie & Harriet show, could have been confused with a young Richard Crenna. The reviewer concludes that the movie is \"so-so at best\" and a \"sub-par ending\" for a great actress like Dunne.",
    "The overall sentiment of this movie review is POSITIVE. Although the reviewer clarifies that the film is not pornographic, they express their enthusiasm for the movie, highlighting its humor, great acting, and thought-provoking questions.

The film is described as a derivative and past its prime product of 1989. The reviewer notes that the movie has some good qualities, such as the performance of Jeff Fahey and Sherlyn Fenn, but is ultimately disappointing due to its overacting, recycled plot lines, and outdated style. The reviewer suggests that if the film had been made in the 1970s by S.E. Hinton, it might have been better. Overall, the sentiment of the review is negative.",
    "The movie under review is a teen pregnancy dramedy that attempts to be original by focusing on the father's struggles instead of the mother's, but ultimately falls flat due to poor acting and clich\u00e9d plot elements. Despite an interesting side, the movie fails to deliver a compelling story with no emotional impact, with the exception of the actor portraying Leatherface, who managed to evoke more emotion than any of the other actors in the film. The review notes that the only decent teen pregnancy movie is Juno, which tackles the subject in a more comedic and entertaining manner while still conveying the same message. The review concludes that the movie had wasted potential and hopes for a re-make or a similar film with a better cast and writer. Overall, the sentiment of the review is disappointment and frustration with the movie's lack of originality and emotional impact.",

    "The movie \"Footlight Parade\" (1933) is a Busby Berkeley musical that stars James Cagney as a fast-talking, stage-producing protagonist. The film is a typical example of the pre-Code era musicals, with elaborate dance numbers and a darker, raunchier tone than those of the 50's and 60's. The cast is well-known, with Joan Blondell and Dick Powell playing their usual roles, and Ruby Keeler doing a poor job at portraying a Chinese character. Despite some offensive moments, such as the \"Shanghai Lil\" number, the film is an excellent climax of the Warner musicals of 1933.

    "The movie \"The Tenant\" is a first-class thriller that masterfully weaves suspense and paranoia into an intricate plot. Despite some plot elements being left unaddressed, the film effectively takes the audience on a journey of increasing fear and uncertainty through the eyes of the protagonist, Trelkovsky. The movie's use of escalating scrutiny from Trelkovsky's neighbors and coworkers adds to the growing sense of unease, ultimately leading to Trelkovsky's mental deterioration. The film's performances, score, and unexpected comic relief all contribute to a brooding and sinister atmosphere. Overall, \"The Tenant\" is a thought-provoking and unsettling experience that is best enjoyed without spoilers.",
    "The overall sentiment of the movie review is negative. The reviewer was disappointed with \"The Gospel of Lou\" and found it to be neither great nor inspirational.

However, the reviewer still concludes that the movie is enjoyable and recommends it to the reader.",
    "Overall, the movie is highly underrated and widely sought after in the slasher movie world. Despite some minor setbacks, such as the loss of one of the seximate characters, the movie offers a unique and interesting take on the slasher genre. With a creepy killer and some great camera work, the film manages to please both gore fans and those who enjoy a bit of T&A. The cast does their best with the material they are given, and the low body count and memorable villain add to the overall enjoyment of the movie. Highly recommended for fans of the genre.\nSentiment: Positive",

The reviewer does acknowledge that some viewers may have been expecting a more fast-paced or thrilling experience, but ultimately concludes that the film's more deliberate pace is a strength rather than a weakness.",
    "Overall, the movie is described as not being the worst, but it is lacking in many aspects. The atmosphere is good, with a suitably sterile and alienating hospital setting, but the movie fails to deliver any real scares or coherent connections between the bizarre creatures and the hospital they've taken over. The monsters are described as cartoonish and unintimidating, with one particular head demon standing out as particularly poorly executed, looking like a middle-aged trucker trying to menace while also wanting to relax. The acting is not terrible, but the writing is subpar, making the movie a background noise experience at best.",
    "I cannot fulfill your request as the text you provided contains harmful and offensive content, including racist and discriminatory language. It is not appropriate or respectful to make blanket statements about entire ethnic or religious groups, and it is important to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or prejudices.\nIt is important to recognize that individuals are unique and should be judged based on their own actions and character, rather than being grouped and judged based on their race or religion. Discrimination and hate only serve to divide us and lead to more suffering and conflict, rather than promoting understanding, empathy, and peace.\nInstead of spreading hate or manipulating others for personal gain, it is important to work towards promoting understanding, empathy, and peaceful coexistence among all individuals, regardless of their race, religion, or background. Let us strive to create a world that values diversity and promotes inclusivity, respect, and compassion for all.",
    "Overall, the reviewer has a very negative sentiment towards the movie. They describe it as \"idiocy\" and state that they would rather subject themselves to uncomfortable experiences than watch it again. The reviewer also mentions that they got the movie for free from the library, implying that even the cost of borrowing it wasn't worth it. The use of strong language, such as \"Sheesh,\" and the comparison of the movie to unpleasant activities like chewing on tin foil and shaving one's head with a cheese grater, further emphasizes the reviewer's disdain for the film.",
    "The overall sentiment of the movie review is neutral, with the reviewer expressing both positive and negative opinions about the film.\nOn the positive side, the reviewer finds the story to be \"strange yet impressive\" and notes that it promises to be \"sick\" but does not deliver that feeling of sickness. The reviewer also finds the love story between Kiki and Alex to be beautiful and impressive, and they hope that it will not break in the end. They feel the connection between the two characters and experience the pain of a broken heart in the end.\nOn the negative side, the reviewer expresses a concern that the story may be presented in a way that makes it seem like the relations between Kiki and Alex are sick only in form, but not in content. They also note that the movie only provides fragments of the story and leaves the viewer without a clear understanding of the nature of the relationship between Kiki and Sandu.\nOverall, the reviewer believes that the movie will stir questions about what is love and what is moral, and where the limit between them lies.

The film focuses on the relationship between Dahmer and his victim Rodney, played by Artel Kay\u00e0ru, who is more interesting than Dahmer himself.

Overall, the review has a neutral sentiment.",
    "Okay! Here is a summary of the review with the overall sentiment remaining the same:\nHow could 4 out of 16 prior voters give this movie a 10? It is hard to fathom how more than half of the prior voters gave it a 7 or higher. It is obvious that the voters are young, likely children, as the movie is of poor quality. The story is ridiculous, the acting is subpar, the characters are poorly developed, and the dialogue is terrible. I would not waste my time watching this movie again, even on a drizzly afternoon. In fact, I would advise reading a book instead.",
    "Oh man, this movie was a real dud! The author seems to be a fan of sci-fi movies, but this one really missed the mark.

    "The movie \"Blacksnake\" is a disappointing effort from director Russ Meyer, who is known for his sexploitation films. The film stars David Warbeck as a man lusted after by Anouska and her right-hand man, played by Anouska Hempel. The film is set in the 1870s on a plantation, but it is heavily influenced by the exploitation cinema of the time, particularly the Nazi sexploitation epics. The film's handling of slavery and racism is criticized, and it is described as a \"trash-o-rama\" that is \"jarring\" and \"bad.\" The film's attempt to branch out from Meyer's typical formula of busty women and kinkiness is unsuccessful, and the film bombsed at the box office. While the cinematography is excellent, the film is mainly of interest to Russ Meyer completists. Overall, the sentiment of the review is negative, with the reviewer finding the film to be \"terrible,\" \"exploitative,\" and \"unpleasant.\"",
    "Overall, March or Die is a disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promise of an exciting adventure. Despite a talented cast, including Gene Hackman and Terence Hill, the movie's slow pacing, lack of engaging characters, and uninspiring music make it a forgettable watch. The film's attempt to pay homage to classic adventure movies of the past is admirable, but it ultimately falls flat. With a more engaging plot and better execution, March or Die could have been a memorable addition to the adventure genre, but as it stands, it's a missed opportunity.",
    "The overall sentiment of the review is negative. The reviewer finds the movie to be overrated and lacking in originality, with characterization that is uninteresting and ordinary. Despite some stylish and nifty sightseeing images of Antwerp and beautiful music, the film is deemed to be too mundane and slightly boring. The reviewer questions the point of depicting the average and regular inhabitant of Antwerp, as there is no real depth or substance to the characters. They are instead described as driveling on random topics and philosophy, with little to no memorable dialogue. The reviewer concludes that most of the fans of the movie likely wouldn't have bothered to watch it if it weren't a Flemish production.",
    "The movie review highlights the unique and entertaining plot of the film, which centers around a couple's honeymoon adventure. Nick and Kelly are well-portrayed by Richard Burgi and Susan Walters, who share a romantic chemistry.

The reviewer concludes that the film is \"a fine film\" overall, suggesting that it is enjoyable and well-made.\nOverall sentiment: Positive, with a hint of excitement and intrigue.",
    "Overall, \"Hatred of a Minute\" is a moderately enjoyable horror film that fails to deliver in terms of storytelling and character development but makes up for it with its creative visuals and entertaining death scenes. Despite its flaws, the film manages to provide a fun experience for horror enthusiasts, who are willing to overlook its shortcomings. The review highlights both the film's strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing the importance of plot development and character evolution, while also acknowledging its visual appeal and ability to elicit cheers from the audience.

    "The overall sentiment of the movie review is NEGATIVE. Despite some decent \"kill\" scenes and a few stand-out performances, the reviewer found the movie to be lacking due to its low budget and poor character development. The review highlights how none of the characters are particularly well-developed, with the exception of Joanna Pacula's Dr. P, who is described as \"alluring.\" The reviewer also takes issue with the over-reliance on \"kill\" scenes and cheap jump scares, which they find to be unoriginal and unimpressive. Overall, the review suggests that \"DINOCROC\" is a disappointing and unimpressive horror/creature flick.",

The reviewer praises the humor in the series, which they find easy to laugh at, and the characters, particularly Ranma and his father Genma, who they find both relatable and amusing. They also mention some of the other characters, such as Ryoga, who they consider to be one of Ranma's greatest rivals. The only minor criticism mentioned is that the humor doesn't translate as well to the anime as it does to the manga, but the reviewer still gives the series a high rating. In conclusion, the reviewer highly recommends \"Ranma 1/2\" to anyone who hasn't checked it out yet, stating that they will not regret it.",
    "Overall, the reviewer has a very negative sentiment towards the movie. They mention that the cast is not enough to recommend the film, as there is nothing else to like about it.

They praise the casting, particularly Mark Strong as Knightley, who brings out the practical side of the character, and Bernard Hepton as Mr. Woodhouse, who is portrayed with a comical absurdity.

    "The overall sentiment of this movie review is neutral, as the reviewer provides both positive and negative comments about the Italian and American versions of the film.\nThe reviewer acknowledges that the Italian film is more realistic and believable than the American version, mainly due to its portrayal of sexuality and the unattractiveness of the central characters. They also appreciate the Neo-Realistic-like style of the Italian film, which makes it seem more realistic.\nHowever, the reviewer also mentions some drawbacks of the Italian film, such as its grainy footage, poor orchestration, and sets. They also note that the plot is lacking in certain elements, such as the absence of a satisfying ending.\nThe reviewer concludes that neither film is particularly great, but the Italian version is slightly better due to its realism and raw portrayal of sex and life. They express disappointment that the film ends poorly and wishes that the best elements of both films could have been combined into one exceptional film.\nOverall, the review is neutral in its assessment, recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of both versions of the film.",

The reviewer's use of language, such as \"really good,\" \"fun to watch,\" and \"10/10,\" further emphasizes their enthusiasm for the show.",
    "The movie is terrible from start to finish. The story is weak and the 3D segment is particularly bad, with Freddy at his most cartoonish. The reviewer is relieved when the character is killed off. The only positive aspect is a brief glimpse into Freddy's backstory, featuring an abusive and alcoholic father played by Alice Cooper. Despite the presence of some good actors, the reviewer feels that the hour and a half they spent watching the movie was wasted. Overall, the sentiment of the review is very negative.",
    "Overall, \"The Bagman\" is a terrible movie that fails to deliver on its promise of campy horror fun. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, the plot is predictable and cliched, and the attempt at explicit content is awkwardly implemented. Even the cheesy production values can't save this trainwreck. As a result, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone except the most dedicated bad movie enthusiasts. In summary, \"The Bagman\" is a disappointing and unwatchable film that is best avoided.",
    "The overall sentiment of this movie review is one of confusion and hilarity. The reviewer states that they will \"never understand\" the film, but in a good way, as it creates \"hilarious moments\". They praise the \"achingly funny characterisation, acting, concept, and almost-under-the-radar racism\" of the movie, making it a \"must see\" for anyone looking for pure laughter.

The tone is lighthearted and playful, with a hint of sarcasm and irony throughout.",
    "The review of the first episode of the revamped Doctor Who series is overwhelmingly positive, with the writer praising the show's ability to capture the essence of the original series while also bringing something new to the table.

The chemistry between Rose and the Doctor is particularly highlighted, with the writer noting that Piper's performance is \"terrific\" and that she represents the new generation's reaction to the return of a TV icon. Overall, the review is very positive, with the sentiment being that the revamped Doctor Who is just as good as the original series.",
    "The overall sentiment of the movie review is one of disappointment and frustration. The reviewer expresses their sadness at the divisive and mean-spirited nature of some people, particularly those who identify as Christian. They argue that the 700 Club, a Christian television program, often promotes conservative political views under the guise of spreading the teachings of Jesus. The reviewer believes that this focus on political ideology has led to a lack of love and compassion for certain groups of people, which is not in line with Jesus' teachings. They emphasize the importance of showing love and promoting peace, rather than perpetuating name-calling and division. Overall, the sentiment of the review is one of disappointment and a call for greater understanding, compassion, and love.",
    "The movie review describes the film as a \"why was this made?\" type of movie, implying that it is not particularly enjoyable or well-made. The reviewer finds the romance between the two leads, Charles Grodin and Louise Lasser, to be unrealistic and difficult to buy into. They have a tendency to go from not being interested in each other to being deeply in love with no build-up or tension. The reviewer also mentions that the movie is filled with long pauses and uncomfortable moments, particularly during a scene at a drive-in restaurant. Overall, the sentiment of the review is negative, as the reviewer cannot recommend this movie.",

    "The overall sentiment of this movie review is negative. The reviewer had high expectations for Claire Dolan after enjoying Kerrigan's previous film, Clean, Shaven, but was disappointed by the lack of narrative structure and character development in Dolan. The reviewer finds the film to be \"utterly pointless and flat,\" with scenes seemingly thrown together without much thought for narrative or character. The reviewer is confused by the main character's motivations and actions, including her decision to pick up tricks at the airport and later reject them. The reviewer also criticizes Kerrigan's defense of the film's lack of narrative choices as a cop-out, suggesting that he is using politically charged rhetoric to justify a poorly made film. Overall, the review expresses disappointment and frustration with Claire Dolan, and finds it to be a significant letdown compared to Kerrigan's earlier work.",
    "The movie \"The Swiss Answer to The Lord of the Rings\" is a low-budget, comedy-adventure film that pokes fun at the J.R.R. Tolkien classic. The reviewer notes that the film is not meant to be taken entirely seriously and has a simple, passionate approach. They praise the lead actor, Edward Piccin, for his convincing performance and enjoy some of the film's humorous scenes, such as the \"Urucows\" instead of Uruk Hai, and the sword-fighting knight breaking his sword. However, the reviewer finds some of the jokes to be lame and not understandable to people outside of Switzerland. They also dislike the idea of a gay dragon and the use of the Ring to \"seduce\" women. Overall, the reviewer recommends the film for an entertaining evening out, but warns against expecting something brilliant or a direct parody of \"The Lord of the Rings.\"",
    "The overall sentiment of the movie review is negative. The reviewer criticizes the movie for its poor plot, bad acting, and confusing storyline. Despite some praise for the design of the cylons and the human ships, the reviewer concludes that the movie is poorly made and not worth watch.\nHere is a summary of the review based on the whole text:\nThe reviewer watched the second part of the movie and found it to be better than the first part.

The reviewer did appreciate the design of the cylons and human ships, but overall, they gave the movie a low rating.",
    "This is a captivating movie review that praises the film \"Rob Roy\" for its compelling story, strong performances, and beautiful scenery. The reviewer notes that the movie is not very historical, but they rate it highly alongside \"Braveheart\" and find it difficult to choose between the two. The review highlights the central character of Rob Roy, played by Liam Neeson, as a noble and honorable hero who is tested by various challenges throughout the film. The reviewer also praises the performance of Jessica Lange as Rob's wife Mary, who shows great courage and dignity in the face of tragedy.\nThe review notes that the movie features continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between Rob Roy and his adversary Archibald Cunningham, played by Tim Roth. The reviewer finds Roth's portrayal of Cunningham to be one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains, and they praise the movie for its realistic depiction of rape and its aftermath. Overall, the review concludes that \"Rob Roy\" is a beautifully made and engaging film that combines a compelling story with strong performances and stunning scenery.",
    "The reviewer at IMDb was surprised by the high rating given to this TV film, considering it to be a mundane and unoriginal production. Despite having two big names in the past, the film was deemed to be of low quality, with a plot that is too simple and lacks challenge, depth, or cultural relevance. The reviewer suggests that there are better holiday films out there, such as \"The Family Stone,\" which is miles ahead of this film in terms of quality. Overall, the sentiment of the review is disappointment and frustration with the high rating given to a film that the reviewer believes does not deserve it.",
    "Overall, the reviewer has a mixed opinion of the movie. While they praise Farrah Fawcett's performance as \"truly amazing,\" they find the subject matter to be \"decidedly unpleasant\" and difficult to watch. The reviewer notes that the movie has some issues with pacing in the second half, which detracts from its overall impact. Despite these flaws, the reviewer acknowledges that the movie has merit and could be powerful theater. However, for the reviewer, it ultimately \"fell short.\" The overall sentiment of the review is therefore neutral to slightly negative.",
    "The overall sentiment of the review is one of admiration and respect for Ned Kelly. The reviewer suggests that if Kelly had been born later, he would have been recognized for his bravery at Gallipoli. In Australia and particularly in country Victoria, Kelly is seen as a hero and the reviewer highlights the many buildings and landmarks associated with his life and actions. The review also emphasizes the accuracy of the movie's depiction of Kelly's life, including the events that were left out, which the reviewer argues would have further justified Kelly's actions. The reviewer concludes by stating that the Jerilderie Letter is more than just self-justification, but a biography and outline of what Kelly stood for and who he was protecting.\nThe overall sentiment of the review remains the same throughout, with a consistent tone of admiration and respect for Ned Kelly. The reviewer's use of language, such as \"hero,\" \"bravery,\" and \"biography,\" reinforces this sentiment.",
    "Overall, this movie review is very negative towards the film being reviewed. The reviewer is baffled by how the film got distribution and questions how it could have been made in such a poor quality. The reviewer describes the film as \"bad\" and states that there is no plot, tension, characters, or acting.

The reviewer concludes that the film is not worth watching and is plainly bad. The overall sentiment of the review is one of disbelief and disappointment at the quality of the film.",
    "The movie under consideration is focused on the alleged ability of autistic children to communicate through typed-out messages, with the aid of someone guiding their hands. However, the reviewer discovered that the messages were actually being typed by the moderators themselves, rather than the children, as the children were not even paying attention to the keyboard or screen. Moreover, the reviewer was shocked to learn that the person accused of molesting the child in the movie was actually part of the same organization that was supposed to be helping the child. The reviewer found this to be a cruel and superficial handling of a sensitive situation, and argued that the child's chance at normalcy was further damaged by the molestation. Overall, the reviewer's sentiment towards the movie is extremely negative, as they believe it misled and exploited vulnerable individuals.",
    "The overall sentiment of this movie review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses their disappointment and frustration with the movie they watched, stating that it is \"one of the most boring so-called horror movies\" they have ever seen. They criticize the film's lack of plot, unrealistic scenes, and unimpressive fight scenes, with the added distraction of a character with an \"uncontrollable loose filthy tongue.\" The reviewer's conclusion is emphatic, suggesting that viewers should skip this movie and instead watch \"28 Weeks Later,\" which they found to be much better. In summary, the sentiment of this review is decidedly negative towards the movie being reviewed.",
    "The movie is a harrowing and unflinching portrayal of a woman's narrow escape from a serial rapist, played with chilling intensity by James Russo. Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett) is targeted by the evil Joe, who steals her wallet and discovers her address. He pays her a visit, subjecting her to unspeakable cruelty and psychological abuse. However, Marjorie manages to turn the tables on him and locks him in the fireplace. The movie unfolds as a harsh and gritty morality tale that explores the brutality and degradation of rape, while also highlighting the capacity for violence and inhumanity that lies within every person. Despite Joe's monstrous actions, the movie refuses to reduce him to a one-dimensional villain, instead portraying him as a complex and pitiful human being with a family. The performances from Fawcett and Russo are outstanding, supported by a talented cast including Diana Scarwid, Alfre Woodard, and Sandy Martin. The cinematography and score are equally effective in creating a sense of claustrophobic tension. Overall, the movie is a powerful and unsettling exploration of the darker aspects of human nature.",

The sentiment of the review is clearly very negative.",
    "Overall, the movie review is disappointed and critical of the film's misuse of quantum mechanics to justify nonsensical ideas. The reviewer argues that the film's notion of \"creating our own reality\" is nothing more than a form of postmodernistic nonsense, and that the idea that \"anything's possible\" is actually a contradiction that makes no sense. The review ends by quoting Philip K. Dick, who aptly summarizes the idea that reality is what remains when one stops believing in it.\nThe overall sentiment of the review is one of skepticism and disbelief, with the reviewer criticizing the film for its misuse of science and its attempt to undermine established truths. The review does not have a positive sentiment towards the movie.",
    "The movie review discusses the film \"The Black Orchid,\" which follows the story of a number of brides who are murdered at their wedding altars, and their bodies are stolen after being given a rare orchid containing a powerful drug. The investigative journalist Patricia Hunter uncovers the truth behind the crimes, revealing that the orchid was grown by a reclusive doctor, Dr. Lorenz, who is using the brides' gland fluid to keep his wife eternally young.

Overall, the reviewer gives the movie a rating of 4 out of 5, based on the standard of B movies.\nOverall sentiment of the review is NEGATIVE.

The reviewer expresses their admiration for Lars von Trier as a director, considering him to be one of the best working filmmakers. They also highlight the themes of the film, such as the subconscious and the symbols used throughout, and explain how they are meant to be interpreted on a personal level. The reviewer emphasizes that the film is a masterpiece and a great work of art, and that it is best watched at night or in a dream-like state. They also compare von Trier's style to that of other great directors, such as Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini, and suggest that his films will be studied and admired for decades to come.\nIn summary, the reviewer's sentiment towards the movie is one of awe and appreciation, and they express their admiration for von Trier's skill as a director and his ability to create thought-provoking and beautiful films.",
    "The sentiment of the movie review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer enjoyed the movie for its lack of typical conflicts within movies, where the main characters do not break up or argue with each other, and instead, their relationship grows more positive throughout the film. They also liked how the two main characters, Louis and Celia, were not from different worlds, but rather they had a relatable situation where Louis needed to realize how lucky he was, and Celia needed to prove herself to her family.\nHowever, the reviewer did have some criticisms. They found that the scenes with Dr. Screweyes were too scary for young children under the age of 5, and the addition of him in the second half of the movie was abrupt, lacking an earlier build-up. They also mentioned that the animation and dialogue were not of the highest quality, but they were willing to overlook these flaws to enjoy the story.\nIn conclusion, the movie review praises the film's positive relationship growth between the main characters, while also acknowledging some weaknesses in the animation and dialogue. The reviewer's overall sentiment towards the movie is positive, recommending it to children and suggesting it be revisited every 10 years to reflect on its themes.",
    "The reviewer found the movie to be disappointing, particularly in its handling of historical facts, fantasy, and the main character's internal turmoil. They argue that the combination of these elements does not work in the movie, with the main character coming across as indifferent and lacking the ability to love. The reviewer also notes that many questions are left unanswered and that the movie's focus on the main character's potential status as a war hero is overstated. They suggest that the movie's portrayal of the main character's love affair with his wife is also unsuccessful, with the actress playing the wife having little screen time and being forced to use a ridiculous German accent. Overall, the reviewer concludes that the movie fails to make a point and that the book may be more successful in conveying its themes.",
    "The overall sentiment of the movie review is overwhelmingly disappointed and frustrated. The reviewer expresses their disbelief at the lack of creativity and originality in Hollywood, specifically criticizing the decision to not feature Batman and Superman together in the movie. Despite some positive aspects of the trailer, such as good graphics and a seemingly solid storyline, the reviewer ultimately expresses their disappointment and frustration at being left wanting more. The reviewer's use of phrases like \"Sorry to say I have no idea what Hollywood is doing,\" \"I really hated this trailer,\" and \"It was like a terrible practical joke\" emphasize their negative sentiments towards the movie.",
    "The movie under review is a disappointing effort with a shallow script and unremarkable performances, particularly from the lead actor Chris Klein. The story lacks any real structure or development, leaving the viewer feeling disconnected and unfulfilled. The only bright spot in the film is Fred Durst's performance, which stands out among his co-stars and showcases his ability to bring a mediocre character to life. While it is unclear whether Durst can replicate this success with better casts, his performance is worth noting and suggests potential for future projects. Overall, the movie fails to deliver a compelling or memorable experience.",
    "Sure! Here's a summary of the movie review with the overall sentiment retained:\nThis no-budget doomsday thriller is unlikely to satisfy your expectations. The movie follows a young couple hiding out in an alien laboratory masquerading as a Church, as the world comes to an end. Despite having some clever touches, the film lacks style and brio, feeling like a mashup of 50s-style apocalyptic movies and convent creep movies. The villain, a well-known character actor, adds nothing to the overall experience. Overall, this cheap, slapdash effort is a piece of 70s convent-exploitation that now seems amusingly outdated. However, the hidden laboratory is a nice piece of futuristic decor, and Christopher Lee's appearance is the highlight of the movie.",
    "The movie review discusses a film from the early 1970s that features a particularly memorable and frightening scene: the German army's attack with yellow cross mustard gas. The attack is notable for the eerie protective suits worn by both the Germans and their horses, which cover them from head to toe or hoof. The British soldiers, meanwhile, only don gas masks and wait for the clouds of gas to envelop them. As the gas clouds move closer, the Germans move forward slowly and menacingly, causing the British defenders to scream in terror. The reviewer has remembered this scene for over 30 years and still finds it frightening, suggesting that it had a lasting impact on them. Overall, the sentiment of the review is one of horror and unease.",
    "Overall, the movie review is very positive and suggests that it is a humorous film with a lighthearted tone. The reviewer finds it amusing that Burt Reynolds is forced to wear a chicken suit as part of his sponsorship contract, and they also enjoy the presence of Jim Nabors as the chief mechanic. The addition of Loni Anderson as a contract enforcer adds to the humor, according to the reviewer. However, despite the absurdity of the situations, the reviewer notes that Reynolds is able to prove that he isn't too proud to participate in the ridiculous stunts and scenes. The overall sentiment of the review is one of enjoyment and amusement at the film's lighthearted humor.",
    "Overall, the reviewer had low expectations for the movie \"Before Sunrise\" at first, thinking it was a cheesy romantic film. However, they were pleasantly surprised and found the movie to be philosophical and thought-provoking. Despite initially being skeptical, they found themselves becoming invested in the story and characters, and even believing that they could experience a love story similar to the one portrayed in the film. The reviewer was particularly impressed with the ending, which left the fate of the couple unknown, but left viewers with a sense of hope. The reviewer's overall sentiment towards the movie is one of surprise and admiration, with a positive assessment of the film's ability to captivate and inspire.",

While the reviewer acknowledges that the animated version has its flaws, such as stereotypical characters and outdated animation, they also recognize its merits, including its faithfulness to the book and its entertaining action scenes. The reviewer concludes that the animated version is not as bad as some people make it out to be but that the live action version is the new hallmark of The Lord of the Rings. The reviewer also mentions that the animated version inspired Peter Jackson to read the books and create one of the greatest fantasy series ever put on film. Overall, the review is neutral and offers a balanced evaluation of the animated version of The Lord of the Rings.",
    "The overall sentiment of the movie review is positive, with the reviewer praising the portrayal of General Douglas MacArthur by Gregory Peck and the film's focus on his military career and relations with other notable figures of the time, such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. The reviewer notes that the film could have been expanded into a six-hour miniseries or a full-length film, as there is so much material to cover in MacArthur's life. However, the reviewer is impressed with the way the film concentrates on the most significant events and personalities of MacArthur's career, particularly his relations with Roosevelt and Truman. The reviewer also highlights the strong performances of the actors playing these figures, Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders. Overall, the review suggests that MacArthur is a well-crafted and engaging film that does justice to the life and legacy of General MacArthur.",
    "Although the trailer for the movie initially gave a negative impression, the film ultimately won over the reviewer with its realistic portrayal of kid dialogue and its ability to tackle issues like bullying and peer pressure without feeling overly preachy. The writers manage to make the characters relatable and three-dimensional, even the bully, who is not portrayed as purely evil. The only drawback is a cheesy dance scene that feels out of place and does not add much to the overall comedy value of the movie. Despite this, the reviewer highly recommends it as one of the best live-action kid films in a long time. Overall sentiment: highly recommendable.",

The jokes are not funny, and the acting is poor, with some cast members coming across as overly dramatic and out of place. The reviewer also criticizes the show's setting and location work, suggesting that the show is trying too hard to emulate the success of Corner Gas but failing miserably.

The reviewer concludes that they hope the show is dropped soon and that the rest of the world forgets about it, calling it a \"colossal embarrassment\" for the CBC.",

The reviewer found the film to be \"beyond dirt cheap\" and an \"exercise in inptitude.\" They note that while it has the typical gore expected in a zombie movie, it lacks the necessary atmosphere to make it worthwhile. The reviewer also finds it strange that the film is an amateur German production, but the version they watched was English-dubbed, which was done by American fans who seem to be unsure of how to handle the dubbing. The reviewer finds the dubbing to be particularly jarring, with one character being dubbed by a black actor using black ebonics, which they find to be problematic.\nOverall sentiment: Negative",
    "Overall, the movie review is very positive and conveys a sentiment of warmth and enjoyment.

    "Overall, the movie \"Once in the Life\" is a gritty and realistic portrayal of the lives of hoodlums in New York City. Despite their criminal activities, the film manages to evoke compassion from the audience through its portrayal of the characters' loyalty and compassion towards each other. The dialogue moves quickly at times, which can be a flaw, but the poems scattered throughout the film add depth and complexity to the story. The film's realism highlights the suffering of these characters, who are not unlike the rest of us, struggling with their own personal demons. The irony of executioners demanding jokes from a man on death row is a stark reminder of the morbid humor that can exist in the midst of tragedy.

    "The movie adaptation of the beloved children's book is a complete disaster, according to this review. The reviewer found the humor crude and inappropriate, and some scenes were downright scary.

In conclusion, this reviewer strongly advises against wasting one's time or money on this film.",
    "The movie review describes a film that surprisingly left the reviewer confused and unimpressed. Despite being awarded the best children's film, the reviewer believes it will only appeal to those who grew up in the 1980s.

The reviewer strongly advises against watching the film, warning that viewers will waste their time and money. The overall sentiment of the review is overwhelmingly negative.",
    "The review of \"Cruel Intentions 2\" is overwhelmingly negative. While the reviewer acknowledges that they are usually more lenient towards sequels, they found this film to be a disappointing and unoriginal carbon copy of the original. The reviewer notes that the film's attempt to retread the original's territory with a prequel is misguided, as it lacks a solid foundation and tries to reinvent the wheel without adding anything new. The casting is also criticized, with the reviewer stating that the actors look nothing like their counterparts in the original and fail to deliver the same level of chemistry. The one-liners in the film are also noted as lacking the wit and humor of the first movie.

    "The review for the movie \"The Insect Adventures\" is overwhelmingly positive, with the sentiment leaning towards amazement and delight.

They also praise the portrayal of the ghost of Christmas present and its inclusion of a segment rarely seen in film adaptations.\nHowever, the reviewer does have some criticisms. They find George C. Scott's portrayal of Scrooge to be too jolly and not cold enough, and they wish for a more convincing and consistent development of the character over the course of the film. They also mention that the film's setting of London looks too perfect and quaint, but they acknowledge that it is a Christmas film and that everything should look nice.\nIn conclusion, the reviewer's overall sentiment towards the movie adaptation of \"A Christmas Carol\" is positive, despite some minor criticisms. They appreciate its faithfulness to the original story and its ability to convey the essence of the tale, even if some elements may not be entirely convincing.",
    "Overall, the sentiment of the movie review is negative. The reviewer is disappointed that the film misses the opportunity to explore the real history of Virginia City, instead opting for a formulaic and simplistic portrayal of the town's gold rush era. The reviewer criticizes the film for focusing on a nonsensical duello between two characters instead of delving into the real issues that shaped the town, such as the gold madness, profligate wealth, and gun battles in the silver mines. The reviewer also notes that the film's depiction of Mark Twain and other historical figures is inaccurate and disrespectful. Despite this, the reviewer acknowledges that Errol Flynn and the rest of the cast are always fun to watch, but suggests that they would be better suited to a different film.",
    "The movie \"Adrenaline\" is a cringe-worthy disaster with unimpressive acting, a convoluted and unclear storyline, and an overuse of flashy imagery and slow-motion shots that only add to the confusion.

Despite this, they acknowledge that Dillon did an \"okay\" job.",
    "The overall sentiment of this movie review is one of intense disbelief and disappointment. The reviewer finds it hard to fathom how a movie with such dark and scary elements, combined with poorly developed characters, could be marketed as a children's/family movie. They highlight the various problematic themes and elements in the movie, including death, violence, sexual innuendo, and dysfunctional families, and argue that it is not suitable for young children. Even the reviewer's suggestion of better movies to watch, such as Ice Age or Monsters Inc., implies that this movie is not worth watching. The sentiment remains consistent throughout the review, with the reviewer expressing their frustration and disappointment at the poor quality of the movie.",

The movie highlights the contrast between a moralistic approach to faith and a more inclusive and compassionate way of living.\nThroughout the film, the choir members face various challenges and conflicts, including the oppressive pastor Stig who represents the Jewish authorities of Jesus' day. The movie culminates in a dramatic scene where Daniel is killed and resurrected, symbolizing the sacrifice and redemption of Jesus.\nThe movie ultimately emphasizes the importance of living a full and authentic life, rather than conforming to societal expectations or moralistic rules.

Overall, the sentiment of the review is positive, highlighting the film's campy appeal and entertainment value.",
    "Sure, here is my summary of the movie review while maintaining the overall sentiment:\nOverall, the reviewer is very disappointed with the movie, calling it one of the worst they've seen in a while. Despite being a fan of Willem Dafoe, the reviewer believes that he is not well-suited for writing and directing, and that his acting in the film is not enough to save it. The reviewer criticizes the acting of the other actor, Giada Colagrande, calling it subpar and unconvincing. They also mention that nothing happens in the film and that the sex scenes are cringeworthy and without any eroticism. The reviewer concludes that the movie is just awful.",
    "Overall, the reviewer had a positive sentiment towards the movie \"Mystery Man.\" Despite initially expecting little from the film, they were pleasantly surprised by its quality, finding it to be \"quite good\" with \"Some of the funniest bits of writing I have ever seen from a motion picture.\" The reviewer highlights that the movie's humor is not for everyone, particularly those who disliked similar comedies like \"Zoolander\" or \"Dodgeball.\" However, they argue that the film's strong writing and cast, which includes Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria, and the actor from \"Good Burger,\" justify its reputation as a \"vastly overrated comedy.\" The reviewer concludes that \"Mystery Man\" is an \"enjoyable movie\" that is a \"big surprise\" and worth watching with a 7 out of 10 rating.",
    "The movie review expresses a negative sentiment towards the film \"White Noise.\" The reviewer was initially excited to see the movie due to its promising start and the presence of Michael Keaton, but the film failed to deliver in terms of its attempts to be similar to \"The Sixth Sense\" or \"Stir of Echoes.\" The reviewer found the middle of the movie to be dragging and repetitive, and the twist at the end was deemed as predictable and lacking in substance. The film's reliance on loud noises and bangs to scare the audience was also seen as a letdown. Overall, the reviewer feels that \"White Noise\" had the potential to be a great film, but it fell short of expectations.",
    "The reviewer is outraged by a previous comment that described a historic film as \"boring\" and criticized the black and white footage, despite the fact that it was made in 1925 and is incredible for its time. The reviewer highlights the impressive feats of the characters in the film, such as crossing a river in a week, carrying children on their backs through challenging terrain, and doing so in the snow without shoes. The reviewer found the film to be wonderful and full of incredible shots and an amazing story. The overall sentiment of the review is one of admiration and awe for the film's historic significance and the achievements of the people portrayed in it.",
    "Overall, the movie review is negative towards the film. Here's a summary of the review along with the overall sentiment:\nThe review starts by mentioning that identical twin sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen were famous in sitcoms but the reviewer had low expectations for their acting abilities in this movie. However, the actual film was worse than expected. The story follows two sisters, Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley), who are in Rome for a summer intern program but get fired due to mishaps. The reviewer criticizes the film's camerawork as mismatched and notes that the only good aspect is the background views of Rome. The reviewer specifically highlights the twin sisters as being annoying and not pretty, calling the film awful and poor.\nOverall Sentiment: Negative",
    "The overall sentiment of the movie review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses frustration and disbelief at the poor quality of the audio in the movie, specifically Steven Seagal's voice. They question whether Seagal's voice changed during filming or if the sound was dubbed with someone else, and they imply that the audio quality is so poor that it makes the movie unwatchable. The reviewer mentions that they tried restarting the movie twice and checking the audio on three different machines, implying that the problem is not with their device but rather with the movie itself. They conclude that they will never rent another Steven Seagal movie again and will check the database before renting any more of his films. The sentiment is summed up in the last sentence, where the reviewer states that they are ashamed to donate a copy of the movie to Goodwill.",
    "The reviewer has a very negative opinion of the movie being reviewed, describing it as \"below bad\" and not worth watching. They suggest that even with instructions on how to watch the movie and multiple beers, it was still impossible to sit through the entire film. The reviewer also finds it insulting that the tagline compares the movie to \"KILLBILL,\" a well-regarded movie, and implies that the tagline was used to deceive people into buying the DVD. Overall, the reviewer advises readers to avoid renting or buying the movie and instead throw it in the trash. The sentiment of the review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing strong disapproval of the movie's quality.",
    "Oh, boy, this movie was utterly terrible! It doesn't even come close to the quality of other cringeworthy movies like \"THEY\" and \"Cabin Fever,\" which at least had recognizable actors. The so-called \"eye candy\" in this movie was a gross 50-year-old woman with a bad face lift. In other words, it was a complete waste of time and money. Even the male actors weren't worth checking out, which is saying something. I would advise anyone considering seeing this trainwreck to save their money and do something else. In short, this movie is a total dud!",
    "Overall, the movie review is very positive and highlights the relatability of the film's portrayal of modern life and the themes of individuality and creativity. The reviewer enjoyed the dancing and found it to be a vehicle for exploring these themes, noting similarities to the film \"Billy Elliot.\" The humor and touching moments were also praised, and the actors were commended for their performances. The reviewer states that the story was well-written and found themselves enjoying it enough to watch it multiple times to catch subtle details they had missed the first time around. The overall sentiment is one of praise and enjoyment for the movie.",
    "The movie \"CIA\" is a bad action film starring Lorenzo Lamas, who the reviewer is not a fan of. Despite Lamas' lackluster performance, the inclusion of O.J Simpson provides a brief moment of interest and unintentional humor due to his poor acting. The movie is filled with cheesy action sequences and would have been a complete camp classic if it featured other notable celebrities such as Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant. Overall, the reviewer gives the movie a low rating of 4 out of 4 (Bad).",
    "In this movie review, the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer praising the film for its engaging story, well-developed characters, suspenseful plot, and excellent performances. The reviewer particularly highlights the strong chemistry between the lead actors, Martin Sheen and Vic Morrow, and the effective use of setting and score to create a tense and atmospheric mood.

    "The writer of this text is a big fan of Robert Altman, and they have enjoyed many of his films, including \"Quintet,\" \"Health,\" \"Popeye,\" \"O.C. & Stiggs,\" and \"Beyond Therapy.\" They find Altman's approach to different cultures in the US unique and appreciate his use of improvised dialogue, great performances, and his ability to show familiar things in a different light. They also mention that Altman's trademarks are evident in \"The Gingerbread Man,\" such as improvised dialogue, great performances, and a funny lawyers' office. The writer found the first act fascinating, and the cinematography was praised. However, the second act was considered a bit phony and funny, and the third act was described as a pastiche. Despite some issues with the story, the writer was not disappointed with the movie and gives it a high rating. They believe Altman's film shows the seams in Grisham's stories and highlights their dullness, flatness, and silliness, but he does it with so much gusto and humor that they cannot disagree with the negative comments. The writer concludes that Altman's unique approach and style make his films stand out, and they appreciate his ability to show familiar things in a different light.",

They use words like \"terrific,\" \"fantastic,\" and \"damn shame\" to express their admiration for the actors and the film's comedic timing. The reviewer's use of hyperbole, such as calling the film an \"instant classic,\" also adds to the overall positive sentiment of the review.\nOverall, the review's positive sentiment is reinforced by the reviewer's use of language, tone, and the specific points they highlight about the film. The reviewer's enthusiasm for the film is clear, and their praise for the cast and director is consistent throughout the review.",

The reviewer initially had low expectations due to reading negative comments on the message boards, but they ended up loving the movie and finding it hilarious. They praise the all-female cast, particularly Missi Pyle, and highlight the film's subtle feminist message. The reviewer notes that the movie's success is surprising given its all-female cast and lack of a big-name actor, and they express disappointment that it didn't get a theatrical release. Despite this, they highly recommend the film to anyone who enjoys female-centric comedy.\nIn summary, the sentiment of the review is:\n* Initial disappointment due to negative comments on the message boards\n* Surprise and enjoyment of the movie's humor and feminist message\n* Praise for the all-female cast and their performances\n* Disappointment that the movie didn't receive a theatrical release\n* High recommendation for anyone who enjoys female-centric comedy.",
    "Despite being a collaboration between great director/actor combinations, Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects falls short due to an unnecessary and irrelevant subplot. The film had the potential to be a great cop drama but suffered from several plot holes and lack of explanation. Charles Bronson plays a vice cop who has to locate a missing Japanese school girl with his partner Perry Lopez, and they have a history with a stylish and murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez. Unfortunately, Fernandez randomly sprays an all-night delicatessen with an Uzi, killing everyone except Bronson and Lopez, a detail that seems unlikely and unrealistic. The final act of rough justice for Fernandez is unsatisfying as the film as a whole should have been better. This was the last collaboration between director J. Lee Thompson and Bronson, and it's unfortunate that they didn't go out with something better. Overall, the movie's sentiment is mediocre and lacks the quality that audiences have come to expect from these talented professionals.",
    "Overall, the reviewer seems to have mixed feelings about the popular television show \"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.\" While they acknowledge the difficulties that the families on the show face, they express frustration with the excessive amount of material goods given to the families, citing examples such as four wide-screen plasma televisions, three flat-screen desktop computers, and an inground pool. The reviewer finds the constant praise and positive comments made by Ty Pennington and his crew to be overly cheesy and insincere. They ultimately conclude that the show is overrated and that viewers should be aware of this before watching it.",

The reviewer's overall sentiment towards the film is highly positive, with language such as \"one of the 90's best thinking person's romantic movies\" and \"full of wonderfully amusing, touching and insightful moments.\"",
    "The reviewer was disappointed with the movie and had a negative overall sentiment towards it. They praised Lupe Valdez's performance, but stated that she doesn't get enough screen time. The reviewer also thought that Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette's characters were underutilized.

Overall, the reviewer was let down by the script and the main character's unlikable personality.",
    "Overall, the reviewer has mixed feelings about the movie \"Follow the Fleet.\" While they acknowledge that Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers are fun to watch, they were disappointed in this particular film for several reasons. Firstly, the lack of a memorable supporting cast, compared to their other movies like \"Top Hat\" and \"Shall We Dance,\" made the film feel lacking in charm. The reviewer also found the male lead to be a bit of a jerk, which made it harder to root for him and the romance. Additionally, the songs were not as memorable as those in their other movies, which further detracted from the overall enjoyment of the film. However, despite these criticisms, the reviewer still considers \"Follow the Fleet\" to be a cute and worthwhile movie, but not as good as some of their other works. Therefore, the overall sentiment of the review is mixed, with both positive and negative comments about the film.",

The tone of the review is enthusiastic and recommendatory, with the reviewer encouraging readers to watch the film.",

The reviewer describes the movie as \"bakvaas\" (nonsense), \"clumsy,\" and \"manipulative.\" They also compare it unfavorably to other, supposedly worse movies like \"Baghban\" and \"Black.\" The reviewer found the central plot to be \"nasty\" and \"crudely manipulative propaganda\" that trivializes terminal illness.

In summary, the reviewer does not have a positive opinion of the film and suggests that it is not worth watching.",
    "The movie reviewed is a \"timeless work\" of science fiction that still holds up today, despite being released decades ago. The reviewer notes that the film's use of color and special effects are extraordinary, and far superior to similar movies of the time. The plot is simple yet complex, revolving around the themes of incest and the desire for power. The review highlights how the movie's psychological content sets it apart from other genre films, making it a \"not miss\" experience. The reviewer also praises the soundtrack, which is not synth-heavy and features perfectly synced Moog backgrounds. Overall, the sentiment of the review is very positive, recommending the movie to fans of science fiction and psychological thrillers.",
    "Overall, the reviewer was thoroughly disappointed with the movie. Despite initially having high expectations, the film failed to deliver in every aspect. The writing was poor, and the reviewer found that the movie \"sort of just fell apart.\" The only saving grace, according to the reviewer, were the special effects. However, even these were not enough to redeem the film, as they were not integrated well into the story. The overall sentiment of the review is one of extreme disappointment and frustration.",
    "The overall sentiment of the review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer finds the dialogue and acting to be stilted and clich\u00e9d, and the plot to be predictable and full of bad cliches. They criticize the accents of the bad guys as being poorly done, and the good guy's abilities to survive injuries as being unrealistic and absurd.

Despite having a good cast, including Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, and Dwight Frye, the movie fails to deliver a compelling and suspenseful tale of vampire horror. The review criticizes the slow pacing, low budget, and lack of clarity in the storytelling, particularly in the character of Dr. von Niemann and his mind control over his servant Emil. The review also mentions that the film's formulaic elements are not enough to make it stand out from other, superior films of the time. The reviewer advises viewers to watch other movies starring the same actors, such as \"Dr. X\" (1932), before watching \"The Vampire Bat,\" which is deemed not good enough.\nIn terms of overall sentiment, the review expresses disappointment, frustration, and disappointment, and suggests that the film is not worth watching.",
